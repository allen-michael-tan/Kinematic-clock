# Kinematic clock

This repository showcases how Singapore Polytechnic's kinematic clock was made.  

## Clock assembly
Each clock is made up of: 

![Clock parts](https://github.com/allen-michael-tan/Kinematic-clock/blob/main/Images/Clock%20parts.jpg)

1. Clock body [1]
2. Servo gear [2]
3. M2x12 pan head self-tapping screw [4]
4. M2x8 flanged pan head self-tapping screw [2]
5. Minute hand gear [1]
6. Hour hand gear [1]
7. Hour hand shaft [1]
8. Minute hand [1]
9. Hour hand [1]
10. Continuous servo motor [2]
11. M3 plain washer [3]
12. Bamboo skewer [1]
13. Retaining ring [1]

### Pre-assembly preparation

Before each clocks were put together, some components of the clock had to be prepared first.

#### Coating of 3D printed parts

The material used for all 3D printed parts was PLA. This material has the 

#### Hour hand assembly

The laser cut hour hand (blue arrow) was superglued to the tip of the hour hand shaft as shown above.

#### Minute hand assembly

**xx**mm thick bamboo skewers were cut into lengths of 60mm.

M3 plain washer was superglued to the underside of the laser cut minute hand (blue arrow), this is done so to minimize friction between the minute and hour hand as they rotate. 

After which, a bamboo skewer was inserted to the minute hand and superglued (green arrow).

Lastly, on the other side of the minute hand where the bamboo skewer was inserted, black paint is applied onto the exposed side of the skewer (blue arrow).
